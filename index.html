    <h2>About the Book</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Hypercondria™</strong> — a flawless, medically optimized town where not having a disorder is the ultimate red flag.</p>
    <p>Here, wellness is currency, therapy is mandatory, and your daily dose of medication isn't just encouraged — it's celebrated. From Diagnosipops™ to Sadness Management Seminars, everyone's a proud patient. Feeling fine? You're clearly in denial.</p>
    <p>Enter Hloux, a quiet skeptic with a suspiciously clean medical record. When a chance encounter with a rebellious soul named Noni exposes him to the glitch beneath the system's polished smile, Hloux begins to see the truth: They don't need to drug you — just convince you to medicate yourself.</p>
    <p>Together they descend into the pharmaceutical funhouse, dodging Side-Effect Evangelists, Dopamine Influencers, and pill-pushing prophets. Beneath the synthetic joy and curated neuroses, something unmedicated is waking up... and it's not approved by the Council of Diagnostics™.</p>
