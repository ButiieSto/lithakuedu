  <h2>About the Book</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Hypercondria‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî a flawless, medically optimized town where not having a disorder is the ultimate red flag.
    Here, wellness is currency, therapy is mandatory, and your daily dose of medication isn‚Äôt just encouraged ‚Äî it‚Äôs celebrated.
    From Diagnosipops‚Ñ¢ to Sadness Management Seminars, everyone‚Äôs a proud patient. Feeling fine? You‚Äôre clearly in denial.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter Hloux, a quiet skeptic with a suspiciously clean medical record. When a chance encounter with a rebellious soul named
    Noni exposes him to the glitch beneath the system‚Äôs polished smile, Hloux begins to see the truth: They don‚Äôt need to drug you ‚Äî
    just convince you to medicate yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    As they descend deeper into the pharmaceutical funhouse, dodging Side-Effect Evangelists, Dopamine Influencers, and pill-pushing
    prophets, Hloux and Noni must unlearn everything the town has branded ‚Äúself-care.‚Äù Because beneath the synthetic joy and curated
    neuroses, something unmedicated is waking up‚Ä¶ And it‚Äôs not approved by the Council of Diagnostics‚Ñ¢.
